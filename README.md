# 🚀 Antigravity CLI Statusline (Max Edition)

An advanced, responsive, and high-information statusline plugin for the **[Antigravity CLI (Community Fork)](https://github.com/weby-homelab/antigravity-cli)** (`agy`). It features multi-layout adapting to your terminal width, real-time Git status tracking, token counting, active model quotas, and sandbox badges.

---

## 🎨 Layout Showcase

### 👑 Ultra / Wide Layout (Terminal width $\ge$ 180 chars)
The ultimate high-information layout displaying all telemetry fields: system metrics, Git status, active subagents, background tasks, model quotas, and power/battery state in a single aligned row.

### 📱 Medium Layout (Terminal width 130 to 179 chars)
Stacks status and telemetry into a clean 3-line layout to prevent command output wrapping on standard terminals.

### 📟 Small / Compact Layout (Terminal width < 130 chars)
Ensures all metrics (READY, model, CWD, tokens, resources, and power) fit perfectly in a stacked 4-line layout on narrower terminals.

## 📖 Telemetry Legend

You can inspect the legend of all components and icons directly from your terminal by running:
* **Linux/macOS:** `~/.antigravity/statusline.sh --legend` (or `-l` / `legend`)
* **Windows (PowerShell):** `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $HOME\.antigravity\statusline.ps1 -Legend` (or `--legend`)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Nerd Font Glyphs Rendering:** The icons in the "Nerd Font Icon" column utilize characters from Nerd Fonts (V3+). If they appear as boxes, squares, or question marks in your web browser or on GitHub, this is expected since web browsers do not load Nerd Fonts by default. In your terminal, they will render correctly if you have a Nerd Font installed and active. The Unicode codepoints (e.g. `U+F192`) are provided for reference.

| Component | Nerd Font Icon (Codepoint) | Classic Icon | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **State: READY** | ` (U+F192)` READY | `●` READY | Agent is idle, waiting for commands. |

## 💎 Telemetry & Icon Styling

The statusline features a modern, high-density telemetry layout built with two key design elements:

1. **Powerline Segments (LINE1):** Left-aligned metadata components (e.g. State, Git Branch, Active Model, Current Directory, Conversation ID, Host Info, Version) are styled as connected blocks using classic `` (U+E0B0) powerline dividers. Each segment features premium 256-color palette styling mapped specifically to its contents.
2. **Rounded Pill Badges (LINE2/3/4):** Right-aligned/stacked telemetry items (e.g. Host CPU/RAM diagnostics, Artifacts, Subagents, Background Tasks, Sandbox networking, Context Usage bar, Quota metrics, Power state) are rendered as isolated capsules enclosed in rounded caps `` (U+E0B6) and `` (U+E0B4) with a clean, dark-gray background (`#303030`).
3. **Dynamic Warnings:** Icons inside badges dynamically change colors to signal bottleneck conditions (e.g. CPU/RAM load, critical quota limits, battery power under blackouts).

### 🛠️ Configuration and Font Setup

To configure the statusline icons correctly and prevent rendering issues (e.g., icons showing up as boxes or question marks):

* **Install a Nerd Font (V3.0+):** The statusline relies on Nerd Font glyphs. Make sure you install and configure a compatible font (such as *Inter*, *Hack Nerd Font*, *JetBrainsMono Nerd Font*, or *FiraCode Nerd Font*) in your terminal's settings.
* **Integrate with `settings.json`:** The statusline command is declared inside the `settings.json` configuration file of the Antigravity CLI, located in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json` (macOS/Linux) or `%USERPROFILE%\.gemini\antigravity-cli\settings.json` (Windows).
* **Enable Classic Fallback:** If you're running in a terminal environment that lacks Nerd Font support (e.g. legacy TTY, ChromeOS Terminal, Emacs), append `--classic` to the statusline command inside your `settings.json`. This tells the script to use standard Unicode fallback characters and prevents raw 256-color ANSI escapes from leaking into the output.

---

## 🎨 Compatibility Mode (Classic Icons)

If your terminal does not support Nerd Fonts (e.g., ChromeOS Terminal, Emacs, or standard TTYs), you can run the statusline in **Classic Icon Mode**. This mode replaces advanced glyphs with standard Unicode symbols (`●`, `◆`, `⚙`, `🔧`, etc.) and plain text labels to ensure clean rendering.

To enable it, simply append `--classic` (or `--no-nerdfont` / `--compatibility`) to the command parameter in your `settings.json`:

### 🐧 macOS / Linux (`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`)
```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "",
    "command": "/home/user/.antigravity/statusline.sh --classic",
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

### 🪟 Windows (`%USERPROFILE%\.gemini\antigravity-cli\settings.json`)
```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "",
    "command": "powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \"C:/Users/user/.antigravity/statusline.ps1\" --classic",
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

## ✨ Features

- **Responsive Design:** Automatically switches layouts (Wide, Medium, Small) depending on terminal width (`terminal_width`) to avoid messy line wrapping.
- **Smart Git Tracking:** Queries the Git binary (`git -C`) directly with a 1-second timeout safeguard to get real-time branch status and dirty states, bypassing cached session details and preventing hangs on slow/unreachable network mounts.
- **Dynamic Quota Swapping:** Automatically detects the current LLM model (Gemini vs. 3rd-party models) and switches to display the correct active quotas (`gemini-5h` & `gemini-weekly` or `3p-5h` & `3p-weekly`) along with countdowns to quota reset.
- **Context & Token Metres:** Displays a visual 20-segment context window bar with percentage, and displays total input/output tokens in a human-readable (`K`, `M`) format.
- **Current Turn Token Usage:** Tracks the input/output tokens processed during the last turn (e.g. `turn: +40.5K/318`).
- **Sandbox Network Badges:** Displays whether the execution sandbox is `ON (net)`, `ON (no-net)`, or `OFF`.
- **Background Actions Tracker:** Live metrics showing active subagents count (`󱙺`) and running background tasks (``).
- **CLI & Session Metadata:** Displays the current `agy` CLI version, subscription tier (e.g. `Google AI Pro`), and logged-in account email.
- **Resilient Power & Host Tracking:** Live display of the host machine's name, Tailscale connection IP, and mains/battery status via dynamic hardware supply scanning (supporting any AC/BAT device combination) to track blackout states.

## 📝 Important Notes & Release History

### 🚀 Release v0.1.4 (July 8, 2026)
- **Git Timeout Resilience**: Added a 1-second timeout wrapper around all Git calls to prevent terminal statusline hangs on slow, unreachable network mounts (NFS, Samba) or extremely large repositories.
- **Universal Power Supply Scanning**: Replaced hardcoded battery/AC adapter paths with dynamic wildcard scanning to correctly identify any battery (`BAT0`, `BAT1`, `BATT`) and AC adapter (`AC`, `ACAD`, `ADP1`) combination on laptops and UPS systems.

### 🚀 Release v0.1.3 (June 16, 2026)
- **One-liner Web Installation**: Added full support for direct internet-based installation using `curl` or `wget` (without cloning the repository locally) for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **Sudo Safety Check**: Added an active check to block execution when run with `sudo` or as `root` via `sudo` on Linux/macOS to protect local user home directory permissions.

### 🚀 Release v0.1.2 (June 15, 2026)
- **Classic Compatibility Mode**: Added support for terminals without Nerd Fonts (e.g. ChromeOS Terminal, Emacs, legacy TTYs). You can activate it by adding `--classic`, `--no-nerdfont`, or `--compatibility` arguments to the `command` field in your `settings.json`.
- **Robust Quota Detection & Auto-Hide**: Fixed issues where model quotas failed to show or displayed empty progress bars when using custom/third-party model names. The script now dynamically selects the first active quota and hides the quota block completely if no quota limits are available (`-1` or null).
- **PowerShell Compatibility**: Ported all classic-mode and quota detection enhancements to Windows (`statusline.ps1`).
